Same Product, Different Price:
A Comparative Study of Retail Pricing Strategies
I. Overview:
- This project investigates how the same branded groceries products are
priced differently across major U.S. retailers, specifically Walmart,
Target, and Giant. By analyzing pricing patterns, the study aims to
uncover whether certain stores consistently offer lower/higher prices,
and if pricing varies by product category or unit size. The finding may
inform consumer behavior insights and shed light on each store’s
pricing strategy.

1. Load and clean Products Data
• For each retailer (Walmart, Target, Giant), data from the
groceries categories is loaded and cleaned in Excel
• Standardize column names, units, and price formats; remove
null or product brands irrelevant to the initial list
2. Normalize unit prices
• Convert all pricing to standard per-ounce in dollar format for
fair comparison
3. Fuzzy match products
• Install thefuzz package and use thefuzz to identify samebranded, same quantity across retailers
4. Statistical analysis
• EDA
• Linear regression
• Hyperparameter tuning
• Visualizations
V. Installation/Requirements
- Excel
- Python language
- Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, thefuzz, seaborn, sklearn.linear_model
