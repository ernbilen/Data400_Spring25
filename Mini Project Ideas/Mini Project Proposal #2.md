# Mini Project Proposal 

##### Research Question 
In this project, I will hope to answer the question of what is the best time to book a hotel based on what region of the world you are trying to book. Hopefully I will be able to distinguish hot spots like cities from less traveled places like the countryside and see how much of a factor time has. Maybe look into breaking it down by how many people for the reservation. I also hope to look into how useful having an agent is in booking. 


##### Data source, variables
I will use a data source from kaggle, a hotel dataset. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking. While this dataset is widely used, I hope to look at it from a different perspective. I will find the difference between the time between reservation date and arrival date. I will also look at it from a different angle in terms of agents.

##### Models
A model that could help potentially answer this question is a tree model. I would have to figure out which variables are the most important and make them most significant in the tree mode. Then I could branch off from there. 

##### Affect stakeholders
This would help customers be able to pursue the kind of vacation they want for their families at the price they want. This would also help hotels have their rooms set without having to drastically cut their room prices before the room is empty.

##### Ethical implications 
Some ethical implications that can occur is increased airline travel and travel in general. With attainable costs, people might travel more. Hotels can also just raise their room prices but make it seem like a deal.
