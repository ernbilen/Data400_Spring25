# Mini Project Proposal 

##### Research Question 
In this project, I will hope to answer the question of if time matters from an album and its deluxe is released in terms of billboard chart placement, sales, and engagement in online content. This topic relates to the business concentration since stakeholders would be interested in maximizing their impact in the music landscape. I am interested in this topic because albums like The Weeknd's Starboy came out in 2016 but the deluxe version came out in 2023. Would this revitablize the album and regain relevance? 
I am also thinking about doing a visualization of artists' popularity based on their albums and sales. 


##### Data source, variables
Since this could vary so easily between a big artist and a small artist, I will only be focusing on artists with at least one album and deluxe album off of the most streamed artists off of spotify. From this data I will find all albums with a deluxe version and record the date both were released. 
Since time is part of my question it will be my target variable and billboard chart placement, sales, and engagement in online content will be the features. 
Then in regards to the age and popularity of an artist, there is a specific website that I will scrape that has album sale and artist that will be my main source of data. 

##### Models
A model that could help potentially answer this question is a tree model. I would have to figure out which variables are the most important and make them most significant in the tree mode. Then I could branch off from there. 

##### Affect stakeholders
Artists and labels would be interested in knowing this answer. This would please fans of the artists and give the label more money to work with for the upcoming project. 

##### Ethical implications 
Some ethical implications that can occur are that if more artists start coming up with deluxe albums. This also means they are probably selling it in a physical copy as well which could affect the environment, especially if the copies go unsold and later end in the trash.
