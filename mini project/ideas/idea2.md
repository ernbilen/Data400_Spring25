### Study of International Student OPT - Malena Malka Goldman

**Research Question: What are the most common majors among international students in undergraduate education, and how do these majors influence their likelihood of participating in Optional Practical Training (OPT)?**

Optional Practical Training (OPT) is a temporary work authorization program that allows international students on F-1 visas to gain practical work experience in their field of study in the U.S. after graduation. OPT is typically available for up to 12 months, but students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields may apply for a 24-month extension, allowing them to work for a total of 36 months.

**Tractable data**
For this project, I will be utilizing official data from reputable sources that track international student trends in the United States. Specifically, I will analyze datasets from Open Doors and SEVIS (Student and Exchange Visitor Information System).
The Open Doors Academic Level and Places of Origin dataset provides information on the distribution of international students by academic level (undergraduate, graduate, non-degree) and country of origin. Additionally, the Field of Study by Place of Origin dataset offers insights into the most common majors pursued by students from different countries. These datasets, published by the Institute of International Education (IIE), offer comprehensive and state-approved statistics on international student enrollment trends.
To deepen the analysis, I will cross-examine this data with SEVIS statistics, which provide real-time tracking of international students in the U.S., including participation in Optional Practical Training (OPT). This comparison will help identify correlations between students’ academic backgrounds, country of origin, and their likelihood of engaging in OPT after graduation.

**Data retrieval**
As mentioned before, I will combine and transform data from Open Doors and SEVIS to analyze international student trends in the U.S. By merging academic level, field of study, and country of origin data with OPT participation statistics, I will create a unified framework for cross-examination. This transformation will allow for a deeper understanding of how academic and demographic factors influence students’ post-graduation choices. The links to access the data are the following:

**Correct specification of the model**
To analyze international student trends and OPT participation, I will use a clustering analysis approach to group students based on academic level, field of study, and country of origin. The two main clustering methods I will consider are k-means clustering, which is efficient for large datasets, and hierarchical clustering, which can capture more complex relationships between groups.

**Implications for stakeholders**
This research project and its findings could offer significant benefits for students, universities, and potential employers. Prospective college students could use the insights to inform their decisions on which major to declare, considering how OPT participation may impact their ability to stay and gain work experience in the U.S. Universities, in turn, could tailor their academic and career support services to better align with the trends in OPT participation, enhancing their international student experience. Additionally, employers seeking to hire international talent could use the findings to refine their recruitment strategies, focusing on fields with higher OPT retention rates and ensuring they are tapping into the most promising student pipelines.

**Ethical, legal, societal implications**
One of my main concerns with this research is its political and social sensitivity, especially given the shifting administration and heightened debates around immigration. Public perceptions of international students are particularly vulnerable to policy changes, making it crucial to approach this study with care. The findings could influence discussions on OPT policies, student retention, and immigration, potentially shaping public opinion and institutional decisions. While the insights may help students make informed choices about their academic and career paths, there is also a risk of unintentionally reinforcing stereotypes based on nationality, major, or career prospects. To ensure fairness and equity, the research must be conducted with a neutral, data-driven approach, avoiding unintended biases. Additionally, maintaining strict data privacy and anonymization will be essential to protect student information and uphold ethical standards.
