## Understanding Consumer Spending Patterns in Nepal

- Research Question: How do income levels, geographic location, and economic factors influence consumer spending patterns in Nepal, and what implications do these trends have for businesses and policymakers?

This project looks at spending pattern of people based on their income, where they live (city or village), and what they buy (food, housing, transport,etc.). It also studies how things like inflation, remittance, and government policies affect household spending. By understanding these patterns, businesses can set better prices, offer the right products, and create marketing plans that fit different groups of customers.

This study will use existing data from public sources. The main data will come from the Nepal Living Standards Survey (NLSS) by the World Bank, reports from the Central Bureau of Statistics Nepal (CBS), and Nepal Rastra Bankâ€™s studies on household spending and inflation. These sources show past and recent trends in how people spend their money.

The methodology will involve data cleaning, trend analysis, and visualization. Spending patterns will be analyzed across different demographics using different techniques to highlight key insights. The findings will be visualized through interactive charts and graphs using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to make the information accessible for businesses, policymakers, and researchers.

This project will help different groups of people. Businesses can use the findings to set better prices and improve their marketing. The government can use the data to understand economic trends and create policies that support families. Banks and online stores can also study spending habits to improve their services and products.  

Since this project uses public data, it must follow ethical rules. It will only use general numbers, not personal financial details, to protect privacy. It will also consider income differences and economic conditions in different areas for fairer results. Being clear about where the data comes from can help keep the study accurate and trustworthy.
