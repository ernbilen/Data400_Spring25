# Introduction to the Repository

In this repository, a semester-long project was developed and documented. Our repository was created to make a model for forecasting in the shipping and distribution industry. A summary of what our repository is about is provided below.

> “Analyzing shipping data from Notions Marketing, we created a model to predict shipping rate timings using forecasting models. Shipping rate forecasting involves predicting future shipping rates based on historical data, market trends, and various economic indicators. These forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making, helping companies anticipate market changes and make informed decisions about fleet management, chartering, and pricing strategies.”

The data is a CSV file that contains shipping information from Notions Marketing. Columns consist of 10,000 records with the following fields:

- `shipping_distance_km`
- `order_weight_kg`

- `warehouse_processing_time_hours`
- `traffic_conditions_index`
- `historical_delays_hours`
- `delivery_time_hours`

# What is in the Notebook?

The Jupyter Notebook contains the actual model used and other graphs that help analyze our findings. We imported packages and read in the CSV to make a strong model, which gave us results to then interpret with the use of meaningful graphs.

# What is the Poster?

The poster was created to explain our process and results at a level for individuals who are not specialized within our field. It helps viewers better understand how everything comes together. This poster was put on display for the students, faculty, and other attendees at the Poster Symposium hosted by Dickinson College.
