    "My second idea involves going a bit into my sports side, and wanting to create some sort of visuals or predictions using my datasets. I am aware going into this that there are already tons of projects that have worked with sports analytics. Currently I want to take home/away splits from NFL games and compare them using different measures to see how much of an impact home-field advantage or disadvantage has on a team."

NFL team performance data is publicly available on sites like Pro Football Reference and ESPN, but there is also an R package called \"NFL Fast R\" that helps with scraping data for NFL splits from every game. The data in each includes points scored, yards gained, turnovers, win/loss records, and other key team stats."

    "As of right now, I plan to use Pro Football Referenceâ€™s splits page for team performance, but I may try to incorporate some of the stats from NFL Fast R if they match the categories that I want to analyze further. I obviously plan on looking at key fields such as team name, game date, offensive/defensive performance metrics along with the home/away splits. I think I should be able to filter the data based on location and team and aggregate the stats either over a single season or multiple seasons. The home/away category is my main filter, but in the end I want to know if that affects team performance in the differing metrics that the NFL measures."

    "Initially I want to compare mean points scored at home vs. away using a t-test, but there are many other variables that you can measure as well with this. For example, I may compare win percentages at home vs. away using simple proportion analysis as mean points scored should have an effect on whether a team ultimately wins or loses a game. Ultimately the end goal is to utilize visualizations like bar charts or box plots to visualize performance differences. With multiple variables being analyzed, if there does seem to be a discrepancy, then hopefully I can identify the largest outlier and go from there."

    "For the purposes of this project, it really only is meant for the general public, but for actual NFL teams and coaches, they can use the data to potentially adjust strategies based on home/away trends. It also can be a useful tool for those betting on NFL games as having the knowledge of how a particukar team plays in home and away games can alter the decision-making of said bettors. If there does seem to be a large discrepancy then maybe even NFL schedule makers can use the data to assess the fairness of team schedules and prevent a competitive unbalance."

    "In terms of at least extracting the data, there should not be any issues as the data is publicly available. There are numrous external factors to consider like travel fatigue, weather, crowd noise that are hard to quantify and cannot really be computed along with many of the other variables. Even with the data that I have, just simply comparing one variable to another may not be enough as other stats that are quantifiable may skew the results of certain visualizations."
