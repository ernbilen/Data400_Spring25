## Andrew Scheiner Mini Project Idea #2
### Topic
The second idea I have for my mini project related to my discipline of educational studies is researching statistics on Teacher Shortage Areas (TSAs). These are specific aspects of schools that lack qualified teachers. I could create a lot of create research questions and visual elements with this topic. One idea I had was to create a interactive dashboard combining all of the subjects, states, and school years included in the school years I collect.

### Collecting the Data, Data Source / Citation
My data source comes from the [U.S. Department of Education's TSA page](https://tsa.ed.gov/#/reports). This page lets users generate specific reports for TSA based on school year, state, and subject matter. For my idea, I have collected TSA data on all states and subjects from the 2024-25 school year. I was hoping to be able to collect data across multiple school years, however, the large number of instances seemed to freeze the TSA website when I would try and download data for more than several school years. For the project idea/proposal, I will just focus on 2024-25.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
| State, Subject                                                           |   Count |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------|----:|
| ('Kentucky', 'Science')                                    |  29 |
| ('West Virginia', 'Language Arts')                         |  20 |

### Model Idea
For a potential model to use for analyzing the TSA data, I would likely consult unsupervised learning methods such as clustering to determine groupings and similarities in areas across the country that are experiencing teacher shortages. We could also look at the state of shortages for specific subject areas and grades for different regions of the country and crosslist the findings with economic and population data. This could help give education officials, state officials, and researchers more information on what states have similar shortages and crosslisting with external data sources regarding money could help answer questions on funding.

### Stakeholder Implications
My stakeholders (or audience) for this project would be government officials in the Department of Education who are looking to increase their knowledge/understanding of trends of TSAs across the United States. In addition, state officials who monitor education would be curious in my findings as well. This could help make policy decisions about necessary funding in different areas of the country.

### Ethical Implications
The main ethical implication regarding my project is the quality and representation of the TSA entered into the government's database. It seems like the TSA data relies of user reporting - which begs the question of the quality and validity of the data. If the report input it vague and not interfaced well, this could decrease the dependability of using the data. When making decisions on TSA and funding policies across the country using this data source, it is critical that the most accurate information is portrayed, so the correct areas that need qualified educators are focused on.
