## Analyzing Global Video Game Sales Trends
Research Question:
How do platform, genre, and region influence video game sales, and what patterns can be identified to predict future market trends?

Project Overview:
This project examines global video game sales data to uncover key factors influencing sales performance across platforms, genres, and geographic regions. The goal is to identify market trends, analyze regional preferences, and provide insights for game developers and publishers on what makes a game successful.

The study will use the Video Game Sales dataset, which includes:

Game title and platform (Wii, PlayStation, Xbox, etc.)
Release year
Genre classification (Sports, RPG, Action, etc.)
Sales figures across major regions (North America, Europe, Japan, Other)
Global sales totals

Methodology:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Handle missing values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Convert categorical variables like platform and genre into numeric formats for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Identify top-selling game genres across different platforms.
Analyze regional gaming preferences (e.g., Japanese vs. North American markets).
Compare sales trends over time to detect growth/decline in gaming segments.


Use regression models to predict a game's potential sales based on its platform, genre, and region.
Cluster games into high/low sales categories using K-Means clustering.

Impact & Applications:
- For Game Developers & Publishers:
Helps in targeting the right platforms and genres for game development.
Provides insights into regional gaming preferences for better marketing strategies.

- For Investors & Industry Analysts:
Identifies high-growth gaming segments for investment opportunities.
Predicts future gaming trends based on historical sales data.
- For Researchers & Enthusiasts:
Provides a comprehensive look at gaming industry evolution over the years.

- Ethical Considerations:
The dataset contains historical, publicly available sales data, so no privacy concerns arise.
Analysis should avoid biased conclusions by accounting for data gaps and missing values.
