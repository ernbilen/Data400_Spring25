# Project Description
My mini-project will explore the environmental impacts on rat presence in New York City. I plan to use rat inspection data as the primary inputs of the model and join environmental data like temperature, weather, seasons, etc to inform the model. This outputs will include preddictions of rat sightings based on these factors and ultimately be used to generate predictions and examine hotspots in the city. This will allow city officials and pest companies to target thir surveillance and thus treatment to reduce this issue in NYC. 

# Dataset
The main dataset of this project will be the Rodent Inspection Dataset from NYC Open Data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Rodent-Inspection/p937-wjvj/data. I will also be web scraping weather/temperature/seasons data to support these pursuits. Lastly, I will also find the shapefile version of the rodent insepction data and join the outputs to create a hotspots/targetted map. 

# Methodologies
a. Data Cleaning: I plan to go through and subset the data to only include places with rodent activity/presence. Clean and compile weather/environmental data from different sources pertaining to different negihborhoods in NYC. Scrape any data relevant to funding sources for the rodent issue. 
b. Data Wrangling: Join environmental monitoring data with Rodent Insepction Datasheet. Clean and filter accordingly
c. Modeling: Split and train dataset with a Regression or time-series model. 
d. Tune: Tune hyperparameters and adjust features based on the results. 
e. Combine and import to ArcGIS for hotspot mapping. 

# Impact on Stakeholders
This project will impact communities in NYC and the policymakers who are working to address this issue. Rodent infestations in the city is a big hygiene and thus public health issue. This project will identify hotspots of rodents in the city and find ways to stretch the budget and allocate funding and resources to combat the areas impacted most.
