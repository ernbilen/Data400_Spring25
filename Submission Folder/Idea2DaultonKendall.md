Trying to understand the volatile markets of cryptocurrency, this model looks to utilize new sentiments from reputable news sources to compile a sentiment analysis on a specific currency. This model looks to create transparency within the cryptocurrency space and create more informed investors. This model will utilize past data to gauge the accuracy of the predictions and then create new predictions on current market sentiment analysis.

The data will be scraped from news sites like Yahoo Finance and pulled articles on the cryptocurrencies ticker. The dataset will compile headlines, time stamps, and content and review them for their sentiment. It will then be fed historical data on the cryptocurrencies prices which will allow the model to learn if it was accurate in its predictions. The data will be sourced through selenium and will be cleaned before being fed into the model.

Utilizing a FinBert model as well as a random forest model will give insight into the sentiment of news articles using sentiment tags such as positive, neutral, and negative. These models will be judged using accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score to understand the effectiveness of the model.

The model can benefit traders as well as financial analysts by providing a deeper insight into news sentiment on a broader scale. It looks to give not only current news information but also historical information to see any patterns in news sentiment and its correlation to price. It can aid in trading recommendations and can help investors use sentiment analysis in their risk assessment strategies of the currencies.

In scraping news data, there are ethical and legal implications regarding data ownership, however, the data here is public information without financial benefit, making our use compliant with Yahoo Finances policies. Additionally, editorials and other information in the modeling could lead to errors in output creating misinformation, and have the potential to inform poor financial decision-making. Addressing the bias in the training data will be crucial to maintain transparency in the model's decision-making and help mitigate any risks that come with the model.

In leveraging web scraping and news sentiment models, our sentiment analysis model looks to provide helpful insight into understanding the complexities of the cryptocurrency markets. This model looks to continue to grow and provide more fine tunes and live updates in the future, breaking down the hierarchy of information within the cryptocurrency markets.
