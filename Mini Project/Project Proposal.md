##### Project Title: Impact of Social Media Exposure for National Park Visits

1. Project Description
In recent years, social media has played a significant role in shaping travel trends and influencing public interest in outdoor recreation. National parks across the United States have seen fluctuations in visitor numbers, and many studies suggest that social media exposure may be a key driver of these trends. This project aims to explore the relationship between social media activity and national park visitation rates using historical data from the National Park Service (NPS) Visitor Use Statistics Dashboard and external social media engagement metrics.
- To analyze historical trends in national park visitation and assess fluctuations over time.
- To investigate the correlation between social media exposure and monthly visitor counts.
- To identify specific national parks that exhibit significant changes in visitor numbers following viral social media moments.
- To assess the impact of different types of social media content (e.g., hashtags, geotagged posts, influencer promotion) on visitation trends.

2. Dataset
- National Park Service Visitor Use Statistics Dashboard: Provides historical monthly visitor counts and visiting purposes (Lodging, Camping, Tent Campers, RV Campers, and Overnight Stays) for various national parks. Such features would include 
- Social Media Data: Extracted from platforms such as Instagram and Google Trends, including hashtags, mentions, and geotagged posts related to national parks.
- Additional Contextual Data: Weather conditions, seasonal effects, and promotional campaigns that may influence visitation trends.

3. Methodology
- Data Collection: Retrieve monthly visitor count data from the NPS Visitor Use Statistics Dashboard and extract relevant social media engagement metrics from available sources with web scraping.
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and standardize data to ensure consistency, removing anomalies and seasonal trends that may skew results.
- Correlation Analysis: Apply statistical techniques such as Pearson correlation or time-series analysis to evaluate the relationship between social media activity and visitation trends.
- Case Study Analysis: Identify national parks that experienced significant surges in visitation due to viral social media moments and assess key factors contributing to the increase.
- Visualization and Interpretation: Use data visualization techniques to present findings in an accessible format, highlighting patterns and key insights.

4. Affect on Stakeholders
- National Park Authorities: Can use findings to improve visitor management strategies, allocate resources efficiently, and implement targeted conservation efforts.
- Local Communities and Businesses: May experience economic benefits due to increased tourism but could also face challenges such as overcrowding and resource strain.
- Social Media Platforms and Influencers: Findings can help understand their influence on travel trends and encourage responsible tourism promotion.

5. Ethical Implications
- Privacy Concerns: Ensuring that social media data is collected and analyzed in compliance with privacy regulations and ethical guidelines.
- Environmental Impact: Addressing potential negative effects of increased visitation, such as habitat degradation, and recommending mitigation strategies.
- Equity and Accessibility: Ensuring that increased exposure does not lead to the exclusion of certain groups or over-commercialization of public lands.
- Responsible Tourism Promotion: Encouraging influencers and media platforms to promote sustainable and respectful tourism practices.
